<h2 align="center">Hi there 👋 I'm Thomas</h2>

In 2023 I decided to make a change and turn my passion for tech into a career. 
I successfully applied for and recently completed a 16-week bootcamp with School of Code (Cohort 15), learning full-stack web development. 
It’s been an amazing journey so far and I’m excited for what’s next.

I am now continuing my learning journey, solidifying my understanding of the fundamentals while challenging myself to continue learning new concepts and technologies.

I am on the lookout for any new opportunities and challenges. If you have any projects in mind that you want to chat about, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
